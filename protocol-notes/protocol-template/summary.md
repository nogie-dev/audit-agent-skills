Mechanism
- Core flow and invariants.
- Value movement (deposits → positions → exits).
- Dependencies (oracles, DEXes, operators, multisigs).

Risk hypotheses
- Bullet expected weak points (e.g., oracle type, fee math, reentrancy surface).

Key configs
- Admins/upgraders; pausers; fee params; oracle addresses.

Open questions
- Items to clarify with team or via code review.
